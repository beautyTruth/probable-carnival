Hello and welcome to Monday evening, August 07, 2023 and the coding journal for that day. I am your host, Phil, and I hope you are enjoying yourself so far this week. I began my IBM data science course this morning. It was basically a Zoom presentation and a follow-on survey. That was it. No learning has begun and we don't even have access to the training on Coursera. Soooooo, that being the case, I'm full steam ahead on my code alongs.

Tonight, I'll be coding along with Tim of Tech With Tim fame. I'm not even sure what the project is, but the title of the video is [Learn Python With This One Project][def]. With that in mind, I'm off to code along.

## It's a Text-Based Slot Machine!

I've paused at 9:41 p.m. to try to sleep so that I can wake up early and finish this and do more. So far I'm at 14:58 of the video having just finished getting the player's bet.

Update, Tuesday, August 08, 2023: It's 12:36 p.m. and I just coded along to the 18:11 point in the video where we check for the bet amount being more than the balance the player has. Last night was another sleepless nigh, and I'm crashing. So I'll pick up where I left off as soon as I am able to do so after involuntarily sleeping soon ðŸ˜….

8:38 p.m. -- back at it after a nap (sleep), a walk, and a healthy, light dinner. Started actually at 9:03.

Wrote this cool function to fill the spinners:

Up and at 'em at 6:56 a.m., Wednesday, August 09, 2023. I'm going to try to finish this project.

All finished, at about 8:00 a.m.
