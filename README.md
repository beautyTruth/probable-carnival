Hello and welcome to Monday evening, August 07, 2023 and the coding journal for that day. I am your host, Phil, and I hope you are enjoying yourself so far this week. I began my IBM data science course this morning. It was basically a Zoom presentation and a follow-on survey. That was it. No learning has begun and we don't even have access to the training on Coursera. Soooooo, that being the case, I'm full steam ahead on my code alongs.

Tonight, I'll be coding along with Tim of Tech With Tim fame. I'm not even sure what the project is, but the title of the video is [Learn PythonWith This One Project][def]. With that in mind, I'm off to code along.
